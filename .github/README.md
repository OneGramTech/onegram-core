OneGram Core
==============

OneGram Core is the official OneGram implementation in C++. It contains all features necessary to participate in the network:

* Full Node
* Validator
* Blockchain RPC interface
* CLI wallet with private RPC

The easiest way to build the software is via Docker. We even provide an official Docker image on Docker Hub:
